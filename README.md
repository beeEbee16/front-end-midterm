Welcome to Bradley's Bookstore. Here you will find various pages, all with different information. The home page is a slideshow of all current books in the store.
I took some time to figure out how I wanted my homepage to look, and liked the idea of a slideshow of items as seen on other store websites. It took some time to figure
out how to implement it, and settled on use timeout to achieve an automatic transition after a set time.

Then the shop page was more straightforward on what I needed. I needed to display all items in a file with their respective information, including a button to add to cart, and a price.
I also added a search option on this page to quickly search and find books that you wanted to find.

Then I added a basic about page as it was needed for the project. Added some typical information like address and phone number. 

The shop page was more involved than the other pages. I added the ability to add items to cart from the shop page as well as the product description page. On the cart page, I add the total price based on the individual price of each item and the quantity of them. I added two button, continue shopping and checkout, on the cart page. The continue shopping page does as it says, takes
you back to the shop page. The checkout button both clears your cart, and redirects you to a basic thank you page. One thing I decided to add was to disable the checkout button and give it a gray
color if there wasn't anything in your cart, so you didn't checkout an empty cart.

One thing I wanted to implement was a sidebar style thing. When you clicked an image to open up product details, I wanted a smaller window to appear that overlayed on top of the main page. However,
I couldn't figure out how to do it. Some things I saw mentioned Bootstrap, but as I don't have any experience in it yet, and didn't want to include any extra downloadable frameworks for the project.
