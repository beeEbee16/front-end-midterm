        description: 'Harry Potter is living a miserable existence with his nasty relatives, the dastardly Dursleys and their son Dudley -- who are quite unaware that he is not a Muggle (a human), and that he is in fact, destined for greatness. One day, owls begin to appear in the sky, peculiar people in cloaks loom in the shadows and before you can say "Alohomora," Harry Potter is whisked away by a scruffy giant named Hagrid to train for his new life as a wizard. You see, Harry Potter survived the attack by the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry\'s parents. In the wizard world, that makes Harry Potter an exalted figure. Now it is time for Harry Potter to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovers that he has very special powers. Will Harry be strong enough to win the game of Quidditch and brave enough to unlock the secret hiding in the trapdoor?',

But just as he\'s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.And strike it does. For in Harry\'s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls\' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley\'s younger sister, Ginny.',

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter\'s defeat of You-Know-Who was Black\'s downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He\'s at Hogwarts . . . he\'s at Hogwarts."Harry Potter isn\'t safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.',

He wants to find out about the mysterious event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn\'t happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he\'s not normal - even by wizarding standards.',

It\'s not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Now Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability of the very government of the magical world and the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts.Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable sacrifice.',
